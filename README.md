# Automatic_Damage_Assesment_of_Vehicles
 This project is an attempt to develop a solution where the damage assessment could be done automatically through images for passenger vehicles


Conventionally, during vehicle insurance claims, the claim assessment is done manually. This whole claims process which involves triaging of claims, assessment for repair and the time it takes leaves a bad taste with the customer. This project is an attempt to develop a solution where the damage assessment could be done through images for passenger vehicles, viz., four wheelers. This will help in faster triggering of claims,better consistency and improved customer experience. Due to the small set of labeled data that we have we explore the effect of domain-specific pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Experimental results show that the models that have been trained on a full network seem to have performed better as compared to training on just the final layers.
